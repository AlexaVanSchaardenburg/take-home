# The DailyBuzz - Simple News Web Appliation

## Summary
This simple news web application was built as a take-home tech challenge simulation during the final quarter of my time at turing School of Software and Design. From assignment to completion thsi application took lass than 8 hours to complete. The application allows a user to view US headlines for the day, sort the headlines by category, and view the article.

The goal of building this application was to demonstrate good organizational skills, effective use of a project board, coding best pratcies, and effieceny and priority of MVP under a tight deadline.

## Wireframing/Planning
Due to the tight time constraints of this project, effective planning was essential. I follwoed this basic planning outline inorder to effectively excecute this project.
1. Throughly read prompt and an MVP to follow in the wrieframing and project board phases
2. Created a wireframe based on the MVP in Canva - focus was on the general layout and functionailty with minimal styling. Wireframe is linked [here]( https://www.canva.com/design/DAFu66CXU_c/Kl_NaddFFFkzknoFO6-81g/edit?utm_content=DAFu66CXU_c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
3. Built a project board with setup, MVP, testing, wrapup, and additional features milestones. The board was built around the wireframe, as I had additional ideas I added them to the additional features section so I could revisit them later if I had time. 
4. Set up the repo with React and created a componenent strucutre - this gave me the architecture in which to start pseudocoding and building my app.
5. Built out MVP, and tested it using Cypress
6. Wrapped up the project including adding documentation and refactoring to make code cleaner

## Testing Instructions
Run the following commands in your terminal to open cypress
`npx cypress run`
Then open cypress using Electron or Chrome to view the tests.
